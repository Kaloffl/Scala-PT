pathtracer TODOs

- camera
	- controllable camera
	- camera shutter shape
	- camera movement for motion blur
	- shutter time
- UI
	- switch to JavaFX
	- settable sample count
	- settable max bounce
	- exportable image
	- pause/unpause of rendering
	- saving rendering status to continue later
	- statistics
		- rendertime
		- time per sample
		- number of threads
		- cpu usage
		- memory usage
		- efficiency (rays vs dropped rays)
	- switchable render mode
		- raytracer
		- path tracing
		- direct light
		- surface normals
		- reflected normal
		- depth
	- catalogs
		- materials
		- shapes & models
		- scenes
- post processing
	- white balance
	- bloom
	- color correction
- scene
	- scene file format (so trees are saved and don't need to be build every time)
	- live scene editing
	- octree based voxel volume
	- shape combinators (union, subtraction, intersection)
	- model/shape rotation, translation & scaling
	- texture material
	- normalmaps for objects
	- portals
- spectral tracing
- Better random sampler
- better ply importer
- command line tool (.scene in -> .png out)
- better in-scattering to allow "godrays"
- progress monitor for all time consuming tasks
	- rendering
	- import of model files
	- BVH construction
- selective splitting (split one ray into multiple in high-variance areas to accelerate convergence)
- single scatter optimization for air/fog scattering
- adaptive rendering (declare chunks of the render done if variance is low)
- photon mapping?
- automatic creation of Attenuation factor for lights (needed for direct lighting solutions & bidirectional tracing)
- Extract air scattering code
- Extract russian roulett code
- Allow Jobs in the jobpool to park if no executable jobs are available
- "prominent lights": light sources chosen to be checked after every ray
	- point lights at first because they are simpler than area lights for this
		- point lights always have the same probability, so it can be multiplied into the intensity directly
	- later consider area lights which need to be adjusted by their hit probability
