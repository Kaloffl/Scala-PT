pathtracer TODOs

- camera
	- camera shutter shape
	- camera movement for motion blur
	- exposure time
	- lenses

- UI
	- settable sample count
	- settable max bounce
	- exportable image
	- pause/unpause of rendering
	- change cpu usage on the fly
	- add timestamps to console output
	- saving rendering status to continue later
		- automatic snapshots every X minutes on long render jobs
	- statistics
		- rendertime
		- time per sample
		- number of threads
		- cpu usage
		- memory usage
		- efficiency (rays vs dropped rays)
	- switchable render mode
		- raytracer
		- path tracing
		- direct light
		- surface normals
		- reflected normal
		- depth
	- catalogs
		- materials
		- shapes & models
		- scenes
	- command line tool (.scene in -> .png out)
	- progress monitor for all time consuming tasks
		- rendering
		- import of model files
		- BVH construction

- post processing
	- color correction

- scene
	- scene file format (so trees are saved and don't need to be build every time)
	- live scene editing
	- octree based voxel volume
	- shape combinators (union, subtraction, intersection)
	- portals (non-euclidian geometry)
	- quake-style BSP with Potentially Visible Sets to optimize indoor scenes
	- Reduce BVH overlap by referencing leafs twice if necessary
		- https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de/fileadmin/cguds/papers/2009/stich_hpg2009/HPG2009_SBVH.pdf
	- Improve the way the BVH  Builder decides to make leaves by basing it on the cost of the new layer
	- Interpolate triangle normals for smoother model surfaces

- maybe
	- spectral tracing
	- bidirectional tracing
		- or maybe the light hint system is good enough?
	- photon mapping
	- selective splitting (find out where more rays are the most helpful)
	- single scatter optimization for air/fog scattering
		- hard to get right and might never be as good as the real thing

- code
	- Extract air scattering code
	- Extract russian roulett code
	- Allow Jobs in the jobpool to park if no executable jobs are available
	- figure out how to efficiently use Units of Measurement in the code

- misc
	- Better random sampler
	- better ply importer
	- improve lighting hint performance by checking hints less often
	- use a BSP for local lighting hints
	- use realistic values for brightness
	- some way to remove the absolute paths to models and textures from the scenes
	- find all shapes visible to each image chunk and only trace them for primary rays
	- Do only a direct illumination pass for the first RT sample
	- AABB Projectable implementation
	- Triable Projectable implementation
	- Fix corners of transparent AABBs
	- create a light hint manager that calculates the importance of a hint for any place in the scene
